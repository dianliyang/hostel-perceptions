## wohkoon Zhexinsun Hostel

- Chinese: wohkoon 者行孙青年酒店

::: info personal perception
The youth hostel, with multiple locations throughout Beijing, provided facilities that, in my experience, were better than those at comparable hostels in the city. While I did not encounter any international guests, I'm unsure if this is indicative of its suitability for them. The main drawback was the occasional discourteous behavior of some guests, although this could be a general issue in hostels throughout China.
